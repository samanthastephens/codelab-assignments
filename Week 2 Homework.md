Describe, in exacting detail, the algorithm to give exact change. You should only assume basic arithmetic functions like addition and subtraction, but be sure to describe how to figure out what notes and coins to give back.

Count item cost. Count money. Subtract the first from the second. If money is less than item cost then demand more. If money is equal to zero then stop. If money is greater than item cost then calculate change. 


If change is a whole number then find the highest note less than dollar amount and add until the dollar amount is matched. If change is not a whole number then find the highest note AND coins less than dollar amount and add until the dollar amount is matched. 

If that doesn't work, keep the change ;)
